The Provider System
-------------------
'Providers' are modules allowing real-time communication between server and client. So far only socket.io is implemented as a Provider, however other can be implemented by following the following guidelines: 

1) provider.<name>.js
	* should require the "provider" module. 
	* should then use the provider.ServiceProvider function to implement a Provider and return it. 
	* then event 'disconnect' should be implemented for each individual client. 
2) provider.client.<name>.js
	* client side version
	* dynamically included for the client
