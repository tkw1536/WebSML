Options in WebSML
-----------------
In WebSML options are stored in the file [ROOT]/data/config.db. 
The settings are stored in the JSON format. If this file does not exist, it will automatically be created, copying the default options. 
The default options are stored in config/config.js (along with some other code). You can change the default options however for them to take effect you will have to delete [ROOT]/data/config.db. 
Some options can be changed via RPC, see rpc.txt.
